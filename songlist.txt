>Trials dark on ev'ry hand
And we cannot understand

better by and by

When the saints of God
are gathered home

>We will tell the story
how we've overcome
We will understand it
better by and by

Disappointments have prevailed
And we've wandered in the darkness
Heavyhearted and alone

And according to His Word
We will understand it
better by and by 

>By and by, when the morning comes
When the saints of God are gathered home

often take us unawares
And our hearts are made to bleed
For some thoughtless word or deed

When we try to do our best
But we'll understand it
better by and by
