>-James 1:1-8
><small>1</small> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ,To the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings.
><small>2</small> Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters,[a] whenever you face trials of many kinds, 
><small>3</small> because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. 
><small>4</small> Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything. 
><small>5</small> If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you. 
><small>6</small> But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. 
><small>7</small> That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. 
><small>8</small> Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.

>-STRONGER

>There is love that came for us 
Humbled to a sinner's cross 
You broke my shame and sinfulness 
You rose again victorious 

>Faithfulness none can deny 
Through the storm and through the fire 
There is truth that sets me free 
Jesus Christ who lives in me 

><note>Chorus</note> 
You are stronger You are stronger 
Sin is broken You have saved me 
It is written Christ is risen 
Jesus You are Lord of all 

>No beginning and no end 
You're my hope and my defense 
You came to seek and save the lost 
You paid it all upon the cross

>-DESERT SONG

>This is my prayer in the desert
And all that's within me feels dry
This is my prayer in the hunger in me
My God is a God who provides

>And this is my prayer in the fire
In weakness or trial or pain
There is a faith proved
Of more worth than gold
So refine me Lord through the flames

><note>Chorus:</note>
And I will bring praise
I will bring praise
No weapon forged against me shall remain
>I will rejoice
I will declare
God is my victory and He is here

And triumph is still on it's way
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ
So firm on His promise I'll stand

All of my life
In every season
You are still God
I have a reason to sing
I have a reason to worship

>This is my prayer in the harvest
When favor and providence flow
I know I'm filled to be emptied again
The seed I've received I will sow

>-ALL GLORY BE TO CHRIST! 

>Should nothing of our efforts stand 
No legacy survive 
Unless the Lord does raise the house 
In vain its builders strive 

>To you who boast tomorrow’s gain 
Tell me what is your life 
A mist that vanishes at dawn 
All glory be to Christ! 

><note>Chorus</note> 
All glory be to Christ our king! 
All glory be to Christ! 
His rule and reign we'll ever sing, 
All glory be to Christ! 

>His will be done 
His kingdom come 
On earth as is above 
Who is Himself our daily bread 
Praise Him the Lord of love 

>Let living water satisfy 
The thirsty without price 
We’ll take a cup of kindness yet 
All glory be to Christ! 
<note>Back to Chorus</note>

>When on the day the great I Am 
The faithful and the true 
The Lamb who was for sinners slain 
Is making all things new. 

>Behold our God shall live with us 
And be our steadfast light 
And we shall ere his people be 
All glory be to Christ!
